1. All start with pthread_ (man -s 7 pthreads)

2. mutex, condition variables. Some implementations have semaphores)

3. POSIX threads do not guarantee that the condition that was true
    at the time of the signal will be true when the thread wakes

4. The first thread that acquires the mutex it held when it blocked.

5. Stays locked. Generally a bad practice.

6. A thread that dies immediately after execution of pthread_exit without
    waiting for a join. (man -s 3 pthread_detach)
