MMAPARRAY			        Program Manual			       MMAPARRAY

NAME
	mmaparray --  use mmap to create, inspect and modify arrays that exist on the disk as files. The program will memory map the file and manipulate it as an array
SYNOPSIS
	simul [--index] [int val ...] [--age] [int float ...] [--filename] [char str[.....]] [--name] [char str[.....]] [--set] [--get] [--create] [--print] [--maxindex] [--delete]

DESCRIPTION
	The program mmaparray simulates the use of mmap to create, inspect and modify arrays that exist on the disk as files.

	The program mmaparray memory maps the file and manipulate it as an array.

	The optional arguments to marker are as follows:

		--filename.................specifies the file name to be used in subsequent commands like --create or --set. If this option is not give the filename defaults to namedb.
		--index....................specifies the index to be used in subsequent commands like --set or --get
		--name.....................specifies the name to be used in subsequent commands like --set.
		--age......................specifies the age to be used in subsequent commands like --set.
                --set......................modifies the array entry pointed to by index with values name and age. Age, name and index hav e to be specified by the corresponding command line option earlier.
                --get......................prints the array entry pointed to by index. Index hav e to be specified by the corresponding command line option earlier.
                --create...................creates a file with name specified by the most recent --filename command and size specified by the most recent --index command.
                --print....................prints all valid entries in the array.
                --maxindex.................returns the maximum index of the cuurent array.
                --delete...................deletes the element pointed to by the latest --index command by invalidating it.

EXIT STATUS
	In successful completion, program mmaparray will memory map the file and manipulate the array according to the command line arguments.

	Upon the occurrence of an error, program mmaparray writes the error to stderr and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLE
	The command:

		./mmaparray

	will start program mmaparray with a filename of "namedb", size of -1, name of NULL, array set to NULL, index of -1, and age of -1.0

	The command:

		./mmaparray --index 10 --name Minas --age 10 --set

	will start program mmaparray with index: 10, name: Minas, age: 10.000000 and set the array at index 10 with the name Minas and the age 10.000000 and make it valid.
